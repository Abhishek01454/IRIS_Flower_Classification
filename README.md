# Iris Flower Species Classification

## Overview

Welcome to the Iris Flower Species Classification project! This project focuses on classifying iris flower species based on their characteristics using a Logistic Regression model. Whether you're a data enthusiast, a biologist, or someone interested in machine learning classification tasks, this project provides a practical example.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous "Iris" dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers' sepal and petal lengths and widths, along with their species labels. This dataset is commonly used for classification tasks and can be found in the "iris.csv" file.

## Project Code

In this project, we utilize Python and various libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn, to perform data analysis, visualization, and model training.

Here's a summary of the project's code and steps:

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - We load the dataset using Pandas and perform initial data exploration.
   - Data statistics, data types, and missing value checks are conducted to understand the dataset's characteristics.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - We create data visualizations using Seaborn to gain insights into the data.
   - A scatterplot is used to visualize the relationship between petal length and sepal width for different iris species.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Label encoding is applied to the "Species" column to convert it into numerical values.
   - We drop the original "Species" column to prepare the data for model training.

4. **Model Training**:
   - We split the dataset into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's `train_test_split` function.
   - A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data to predict iris species based on sepal and petal characteristics.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - We evaluate the model's performance on both the training and testing datasets using accuracy scores.

## Usage

To use this project for iris flower species classification, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```

   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to explore the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance:

   ```
   jupyter notebook Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the code and comments in the notebook/script to understand the data analysis and model training process.

## Results

The project provides a classification model capable of predicting iris flower species based on sepal and petal characteristics. Model evaluation on the testing dataset shows a high accuracy score, indicating that the model performs well.
